# ** NOTE: The following problem comes from the first problem set from Gaston Sanchez's version of Stats 243
# offered here at UC Berkeley. You can find his repo here: https://github.com/ucb-stat243/stat243-fall-2016 ***

# Suppose that you are playing the gambling game of the Chevalier de Mere. That is, you are betting
# that you get at least one six in four throws of a die. Write a function play() that simulates one round
# of this game and prints out whether you win or lose. Check that your function can produce a different
# result each time you run it.

play <- function(){
  
  # sample 4 numbers from a vector with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (with or without replacement?)
  # result will be an object that will contain the results of each random sample. 
  result <- replicate(4, sample(1:6, size=1))
  
  # if statement: 
  # if number 6 is in object "result" then 
  if("6" %in% result){
    print("you win")
  } 
  
  # otherwise...
  else{
    print("you lose")}
}

play()

# 1. The birthday problem (Feller 1957) 

# Simulating birthdays for 25 people
birthdays <- sample(1:365, 25, replace=T)
birthdays

# Finding the number of birthday matches among 25 people
X <- 25 - length(unique(birthdays))

# Here we have simulated the situation for one room with 25 people, where
# there is
X
#shared birthday(s)

# Using a loop to simulate X for many rooms with 25 people: 
# If we repeat this process a very large number of times, we obtain many 
# realizations of the random variable X, and thus a good idea of the distribution 
# of X. 
# Counting the proportion of rooms with X = 0, we get the approximate 
# probability of no match P(X = 0) or match P(X>0).
# Taking the average of these realizations of X, we get a good approximation to E(X).

X <- NA # Creating placeholder vector
r <- 10000 # We will simulate 10,000 rooms

for (i in 1:r){ 
  
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, 25, replace=T)
  X[i] <- 25 - length(unique(birthdays))
  
}

# Simulated probability of at least one matching birthday. 
mean(X!=0)  # Very close to the combinatorial solution which is 0.5687

# Simulated E(X): the average number of matches per room simulates
mean(X) # This result is not easily obtained by combinatorial methods.
